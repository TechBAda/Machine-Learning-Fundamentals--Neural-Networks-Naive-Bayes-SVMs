#  Machine Learning Fundamentals – Neural Networks, Naive Bayes & Support Vector Machines

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates core machine learning fundamentals through a series of structured problems covering:

- Neural network normalization & forward passes  
- Boolean logic networks using perceptrons  
- Naive Bayes classification (fruit dataset + breast cancer dataset)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  
- Hyperplanes, support vectors, and point classification  

The work integrates manual computation, Python-based simulation, and applied machine learning techniques.

- Min–max normalization for inputs  
- Sigmoid activation functions  
- Forward-pass computation  
- Parameterized evaluation using real weight matrices
